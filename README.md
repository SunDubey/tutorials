This repository contains learning resources for Apache Spark, Delta Lake, Koalas, [MLflow](mlflow/README.md), Databricks, and other. 

Aside from tutorials, this repo also has talks and workshops I have conducted at meetups and conferences.
Feel free to clone it, use it with appropriate attribution, and contribute by file an issue or PR request.

Stay tuned ... more is coming... :)

Have fun!

Cheers,

Jules
